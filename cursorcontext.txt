Vision

Build an enterprise-grade agent system capable of:
* Autonomous web crawling
* Intelligent content analysis
* Scheduled, user prompted, or event driven task execution.
* Seamless integration with tools and infrastructure

Current State
* Interface: Basic CLI with JSON-based memory persistence
* Experimental Modules:
    * Language: NLP capabilities using spaCy (NER, summarization)
    * Web: Basic web crawling and search functionality
    * Core: Minimal orchestration layer
* Integration: Manual coordination through the CLI

Goals
* Strengthen existing modules with:
    * Robust error handling
    * Configurability
    * Unit and integration tests
* Add vector storage for semantic search
* Improve web crawling with:
    * Parallel processing
    * Rate limiting
* Implement content classification logic
* Design tool interfaces based on observed manual usage patterns
* Build a basic agent framework
* Enable simple task orchestration
* Connect all modules through the agent framework
* Develop a basic user interface (UI)
* Complete documentation and final testing

Development Philosophy
Manual-first, automate-later: Build systems manually first to ensure usability, test robustness, and evolve interfaces naturally before introducing automation.
